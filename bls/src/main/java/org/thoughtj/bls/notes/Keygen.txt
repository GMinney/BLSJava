KeyGen
The KeyGen procedure described in this section generates a secret key SK deterministically from a secret octet string IKM. SK is guaranteed
to be nonzero, as required by KeyValidate (Section 2.5).

KeyGen uses HKDF [RFC5869] instantiated with the hash function H.

For security, IKM MUST be infeasible to guess, e.g., generated by a trusted source of randomness. IKM MUST be at least 32 bytes long, but it MAY be longer.

KeyGen takes two parameters. The first parameter, salt, is required; see below for further discussion of this value. The second parameter, key_info,
 is optional; it MAY be used to derive multiple independent keys from the same IKM. By default, key_info is the empty string.

SK = KeyGen(IKM)

Inputs:
- IKM, a secret octet string. See requirements above.

Outputs:
- SK, a uniformly random integer such that 1 <= SK < r.

Parameters:
- salt, a required octet string.
- key_info, an optional octet string.
  If key_info is not supplied, it defaults to the empty string.

Definitions:
- HKDF-Extract is as defined in RFC5869, instantiated with hash H.
- HKDF-Expand is as defined in RFC5869, instantiated with hash H.
- I2OSP and OS2IP are as defined in RFC8017, Section 4.
- L is the integer given by ceil((3 * ceil(log2(r))) / 16).

Procedure:
1. while True:
2.     PRK = HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM || I2OSP(0, 1))
3.     OKM = HKDF-Expand(PRK, key_info || I2OSP(L, 2), L)
4.     SK = OS2IP(OKM) mod r
5.     if SK != 0:
6.         return SK
7.     salt = H(salt)
KeyGen is the RECOMMENDED way of generating secret keys, but its use is not required for compatibility, and implementations MAY use a different
 KeyGen procedure. For security, such an alternative KeyGen procedure MUST output SK that is statistically close to uniformly random in the range 1 <= SK < r.

For compatibility with prior versions of this document, implementations SHOULD allow applications to choose the salt value. Setting salt to the value
 H("BLS-SIG-KEYGEN-SALT-") (i.e., the hash of an ASCII string comprising 20 octets) results in a KeyGen algorithm that is compatible with version 4 of
  this document. Setting salt to the value "BLS-SIG-KEYGEN-SALT-" (i.e., an ASCII string comprising 20 octets) results in a KeyGen algorithm that is compatible
   with versions of this document prior to number 4. See Section 5.1 for more information on choosing a salt value.
